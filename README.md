# Development Setup

A personal reference repository for my local development environment. This repo documents the tools I use day-to-day and provides scripts to automate setting up a new machine.

## What's in this repo

- **Tool references** — A catalog of the development tools I rely on, with notes on configuration and usage.
- **Setup scripts** — Run these on a fresh PC to automatically install and configure everything I need.

## Getting started

Clone the repo and run the appropriate setup script for your OS:

```bash
git clone <repo-url> && cd development-setup
```

## Repository structure

```
