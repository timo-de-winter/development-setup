# Development Setup

A personal reference repository for my local development environment. This repo documents the tools I use day-to-day and provides scripts to automate setting up a new machine.

## What's in this repo

- **Tool references** — A catalog of the development tools I rely on, with notes on configuration and usage.
- **Setup scripts** — Run these on a fresh PC to automatically install and configure everything I need.

## Getting started

Clone the repo and run the setup script. The script will ask you what you want to install, so no worries :).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/timo-de-winter/development-setup.git && cd development-setup

bash bin/install
```

## Tools I use
- **PHPStorm** is my code-editor of choice
- **GitKraken** is my git GUI
- **Fork** is an alternative git GUI I use, since gitkraken can be slow at times
- **Warp** is my command-line of choice (it has great AI integration capabilities)
- **WSL2** is what I use to run a lot of projects
- **Laravel Herd** for local windows development environment
